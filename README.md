# Instant Coffee

Instant Coffee is a development tool intended to be used for small
mostly-static projects that want to use CoffeeScript but don't want to depend
on node.js.  It is packaged as a dependencies-included jar, so it only requires
the JVM to run.

## Future Features

* SASS/SCSS
* Require declarations
